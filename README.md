# Save the Water
 
Save the Water is a web-based game meant to educate children and youth about the water crisis and water poverty worldwide. The story and game guides you through a simulation of Cheruâ€™s arduous struggles to find water each and every day. The player navigates obstacles like tumbleweeds and birds by jumping and ducking over them as they block their way. Every time an obstacle hits the player, water is lost - emulating the difficult landscape Cheru faces bringing water home to her family. The only way to succeed is to arrive home without having lost all of the water. The amount of water the player begins with is randomly generated (but reflects real circumstances), and the background also changes colour based on the time of day!
